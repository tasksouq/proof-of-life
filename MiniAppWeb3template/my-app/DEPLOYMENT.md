- Ensure your domain is properly configured
- Check that World ID app configuration matches your environment variables

### Performance Optimization
- The Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds for optimal image size
- Static assets are properly cached
- The application runs in production mode

## Monitoring

Consider setting up monitoring for:
- Application uptime
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage

## Updates

To update your deployment:
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Trigger a new deployment in Coolify
3. Monitor the deployment process

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Coolify logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally with Docker first
4. Review the application logs
