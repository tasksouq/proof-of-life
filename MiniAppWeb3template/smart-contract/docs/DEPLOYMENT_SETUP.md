# üöÄ Production Deployment Setup Guide

## Step 1: Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

You need to set up your `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Private key for deploying contracts (without 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key-here"

# Worldchain Network Configuration
WORLDCHAIN_RPC_URL="https://worldchain-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/public"

# Optional: Custom RPC if you have Alchemy/Infura account
# WORLDCHAIN_RPC_URL="https://worldchain-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:

1. **Private Key**: This should be the private key of the wallet that will own the contracts
2. **Balance**: Make sure your wallet has at least **0.2 ETH** on Worldchain for deployment
3. **Backup**: Keep your private key secure and backed up
4. **Never Commit**: Never commit your `.env` file to git

## Step 2: Check Your Wallet Balance

Before deployment, verify you have enough ETH on Worldchain:

```bash
# Check your balance
node -e "
const { ethers } = require('hardhat');
async function checkBalance() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(deployer.address);
  console.log('Deployer:', deployer.address);
  console.log('Balance:', ethers.formatEther(balance), 'ETH');
  console.log('Required: 0.2 ETH minimum');
  console.log('Ready:', balance >= ethers.parseEther('0.2') ? '‚úÖ YES' : '‚ùå NO');
}
checkBalance().catch(console.error);
"
```

## Step 3: Test Connection

Test your Worldchain connection:

```bash
# Test network connection
npx hardhat run --network worldchain -e "
async function test() {
  const network = await ethers.provider.getNetwork();
  console.log('Network:', network.name);
  console.log('Chain ID:', network.chainId);
  console.log('Block Number:', await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber());
}
test().catch(console.error);
"
```

## Step 4: Deploy Contracts

Once your environment is set up and you have confirmed your balance:

```bash
# Deploy to production with real World ID
node deploy-production.js
```

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

After deployment, run the verification script:

```bash
# Verify all contracts are working correctly
node verify-production.js
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] `.env` file configured with private key
- [ ] Wallet has at least 0.2 ETH on Worldchain
- [ ] Network connection tested
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Contracts compiled (`npx hardhat compile`)
- [ ] Ready to deploy!

## Expected Output

The deployment will:

1. ‚úÖ Deploy LIFE Token with real World ID Router
2. ‚úÖ Deploy Property Contract
3. ‚úÖ Deploy LimitedEdition Contract
4. ‚úÖ Deploy PlayerRegistry Contract
5. ‚úÖ Deploy Economy Contract
6. ‚úÖ Configure all permissions between contracts
7. ‚úÖ Verify all systems are working
8. ‚úÖ Generate contract addresses for frontend

## After Deployment

You'll get contract addresses that need to be updated in your frontend:

```typescript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  LIFE_TOKEN: "0x...",     // New address from deployment
  ECONOMY: "0x...",        // New address from deployment
  PROPERTY: "0x...",       // New address from deployment
  LIMITED_EDITION: "0x...", // New address from deployment
  PLAYER_REGISTRY: "0x...", // New address from deployment
  WORLD_ID_ROUTER: "0x17B354dD2595411ff79041f930e491A4Df39A278", // Production
  WLD_TOKEN: "0x2cFc85d8E48F8EAB294be644d9E25C3030863003" // Worldchain WLD
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Insufficient balance**: Add more ETH to your wallet
2. **Network connection**: Check your RPC URL in `.env`
3. **Private key**: Ensure it's correct and without `0x` prefix
4. **Compilation errors**: Run `npx hardhat compile` first

### Support:

- Check deployment logs in `production-deployment.json`
- Verify contracts on Worldchain explorer
- Test with real World ID orb verification
