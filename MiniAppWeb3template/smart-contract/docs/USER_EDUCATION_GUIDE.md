## üè† **Property System**

### **Property Types & Pricing**

| Property Type | Base Price | Daily Yield | Status Points |
|---------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Apartment** | 500 LIFE   | 2%          | 50 √ó level    |
| **House**     | 1,000 LIFE | 3%          | 100 √ó level   |
| **Land**      | 750 LIFE   | 1%          | 75 √ó level    |
| **Office**    | 2,000 LIFE | 5%          | 200 √ó level   |
| **Mansion**   | 5,000 LIFE | 8%          | 500 √ó level   |

### **Property Levels**
- **Levels 1-10** available
- **Price increases 20% per level** above Level 1
- **Higher levels = more status points and income**

**Example:**
- Level 1 House: 1,000 LIFE
- Level 3 House: 1,400 LIFE (+40%)
- Level 5 House: 1,800 LIFE (+80%)

### **Property Income System**

**How income works:**
1. **Base income**: Property type √ó level √ó yield rate
2. **Holding bonus**: +0.1% per day owned (max 50% after 500 days)
3. **Claim frequency**: Once every 24 hours minimum

**Income calculation example (Level 3 House):**
- Base daily income: 1 LIFE √ó 3 √ó 3% = 0.09 LIFE/day
- After 30 days: +3% bonus = 0.0927 LIFE/day
- After 100 days: +10% bonus = 0.099 LIFE/day
- After 500+ days: +50% bonus = 0.135 LIFE/day
